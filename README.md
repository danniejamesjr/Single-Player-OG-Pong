# Single-Player-OG-Pong
Classic Pong arcade game 
This is a Pong game based on the original 1970s Atari video game. It is made to run on any computer running python. It will still retain the old school feel while making some cosmetic changes to make it feel a little more modern, such as color and a little different layout with the paddles and scoreboard.

Pong.py is created to be a single player game type that allows users the chance to reach high scores and compete against others.  Users will be prompted to restart the code when the game is finished and the final score will display.
